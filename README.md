# Hi there, I'm Nafiul Bari Khan 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Go (Golang)**, **C++**, and **system design**. I thrive on building clean, scalable, and testable backend systems—often from scratch. I'm also a problem solver at heart, constantly sharpening my skills through platforms like LeetCode.

## 💡 What I Do

- 🏗️ Architect and implement robust **REST APIs** with Go (Fiber, chi)
- 🔍 Dive deep into **algorithmic challenges** (Data Structures, LeetCode in C++)
- 🧪 Write **unit & integration tests** with mocking and dependency injection
- 🚀 Ship microservices with **Docker**, manage deployments with **Kubernetes**
- 🧠 Learn and explore new technologies that improve backend scalability
